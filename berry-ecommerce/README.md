# Berxy-ECommerce

## DESCRIPTION
This is a FullStack ECommerce website centered around watches. [Here](https://github.com/Bram-G/Berxy-API) is a link to the sister repo that contains the API. I used React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and MongoDB. This is a full CRUD application that allows users to create an account, add items to their cart, and checkout. The admin can add, edit, and delete items from the database. All of these items are fictional and are not for sale. This is just a demo of my skills as a developer. I used a lot of images and information from https://shop.hodinkee.com/, so if you want to buy a watch you see, go there!

## THOUGHTS
I came up with this idea to showcase my skills as a developer as well as show my love for watches. I wanted to use technology I see in the real world on ECommerce sites.
